                    One of the important tenets of democracy is the effectiveness of the state. It is against this backdrop that we have developed africancitizenswatch.org. This is a platform seeking to enhance the quality of democracy in different countries across Africa and contribute towards improved state delivery. This online tracking tool provides real-time information about the policy performance of government. Through this process, non-state actors have evidence that can help enhance their participation in public policy processes and provide citizens with meaningful opportunities to identify their needs, and priorities and give feedback on government performance. This is a precondition for inclusive societies.

                        Through the tracker we seek to highlight the following about democracy:

                            <li>Free and fair elections are a necessary but not sufficient condition for democracy</li>
                            <li>Active citizens are essential and play a critical part in nurturing democracy</li>
                            <li>The work of democracy is the work of citizens</li>
                            <li>Officeholders serve at the pleasure of citizens</li>

                        The hope in the short term is that the information collected and analysed through the trackers will achieve the following:
